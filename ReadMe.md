## Project Information 

Duration: 10 weeks - October 3, 2018 to December 5, 2018

Client: Dr. Barry Cumbie

Value Statement:

```sh
Each iteration of students, under the leadership of Dr Cumbie, promotes new
ways of seeking out static objectsand rebuilding its foundation. A place to present or locate
this loop, allows all stakeholders a centralized  place to collaborate, get information, or request services.
```

## Project Type

* Venture.

The levels of risk can be determined with time and quality of the product 
deliverable.  A large amount of risk can be seen in the quality while having 
smaller group members.This project fell into that risk level having one person. 
As time also would also have same levels as quality, it was lower because of the 
knowledge of coding used was acceptable.
 
```sh
Overall Risk Level = 3
```

  engaging as the standard baseline, so that a user has a unique experience. 

> User Acceptance

    * Easy to navigate.
    * Mobile friendly viewing/interaction.
    * Fast loading times.


* As the editor, I want to be able to make each view have a type of interaction 
between the user and the view, so that the website creates a better encounter.

> User Acceptance:

    * The website flows without interaction.
    * The buttons, menu, etc. has a form of intelligence when interaction occurs.
    * The main navigation interacts with users view point.

to local businesses so that I can learn more information about and who is offering 
the service.
